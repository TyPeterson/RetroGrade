# Apple II: The Computer That Started It All

Released in April 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire, the Apple II represented a watershed moment in personal computing history. Unlike its predecessor, the Apple I (which was essentially a hobbyist kit), the Apple II was a complete, ready-to-use computer system that anyone could plug in and start using.

Steve Wozniak's brilliant engineering made the Apple II remarkable for its time. It was one of the first computers to display color graphics, had an open architecture that allowed users to add expansion cards, and came with BASIC programming language built into ROM. The computer could display both text and high-resolution graphics, making it popular for both business applications and gaming.

The Apple II's success transformed Apple from a garage startup into a major corporation. It remained in production until 1993, with various models and improvements, making it one of the longest-lived computer platforms. The computer found its way into schools across America through aggressive educational pricing, introducing an entire generation to programming and computing concepts.
