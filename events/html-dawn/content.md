# HTML & The First Browsers: Making the Web Visual

When Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina released NCSA Mosaic in April 1993, they fundamentally changed what the web could be. Before Mosaic, early browsers like Lynx displayed only text, and viewing an image required launching a separate application. Mosaic changed that with a simple but revolutionary feature: inline images.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) had been created by Tim Berners-Lee as a simple way to structure documents and create links between them. The original specification was minimal—just enough to share academic papers. Mosaic and subsequent browsers expanded HTML's capabilities, adding support for images, forms, tables, and eventually multimedia content. This evolution wasn't always smooth; competing browser vendors added their own proprietary tags, leading to fragmentation and the "browser wars" of the late 1990s.

The impact of visual, user-friendly browsers cannot be overstated. Suddenly, anyone could publish on the web without deep technical knowledge. Artists, businesses, schools, and individuals began creating websites. The web exploded from dozens of sites to millions within a few years. HTML became one of the most important languages in computing, not because it was technically sophisticated, but because it was simple enough for anyone to learn and use.
