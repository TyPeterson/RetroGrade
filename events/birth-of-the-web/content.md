# Birth of the World Wide Web: Connecting the World

On August 6, 1991, Tim Berners-Lee posted a brief announcement to the alt.hypertext newsgroup, describing his World Wide Web project and inviting others to contribute. This modest post marked the public debut of a technology that would transform human communication and commerce.

Berners-Lee, a British scientist working at CERN in Switzerland, had been grappling with the problem of information management in large research organizations. His solution was elegant: combine hypertext (documents with clickable links), the internet (a global network), and a simple addressing system (URLs) to create an interconnected web of information. He created HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for transferring data, HTML for formatting documents, and the first web browser and server software.

The first website, running on Berners-Lee's NeXT computer, explained what the World Wide Web was and how to create web pages. Crucially, CERN released the WWW technology into the public domain in 1993, allowing anyone to use and build upon it freely. This decision proved pivotal in the web's explosive growth. By the mid-1990s, millions of websites existed, and the web had become synonymous with the internet itself.
