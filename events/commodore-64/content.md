# Commodore 64: The People's Computer

When Commodore launched the C64 in August 1982, it changed the landscape of home computing forever. Priced at $595 (and later dropping to as low as $200), it offered capabilities that matched or exceeded computers costing thousands of dollars.

The C64's technical specifications were impressive for its time: 64KB of RAM, a custom graphics chip (VIC-II) capable of sprites and smooth scrolling, and the revolutionary SID sound chip that could produce three-voice music. These features made it a favorite platform for both games and creative applications. Programmers pushed the hardware to its limits, creating visual and audio effects that shouldn't have been possible.

The Commodore 64's impact on popular culture was immense. It was sold in department stores alongside televisions and stereos, not just computer shops. Millions of people bought their first computer because of the C64, and many learned to program by typing in BASIC programs from magazines. The demo scene, where programmers created elaborate audiovisual demonstrations, was born on the C64. Even today, the C64 enjoys a devoted following, with new games and demos still being created.
