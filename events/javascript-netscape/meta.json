  "significance": "JavaScript transformed the web from a document viewing platform into an interactive application platform. Despite its rushed creation and initial limitations, JavaScript became one of the most important programming languages in history. Today, it powers everything from simple form validations to complex web applications, mobile apps, and even server-side systems. Its evolution from a simple scripting language to a full-featured programming language demonstrates the power of community-driven development and standardization.",
